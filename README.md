# Google-Clone

- I created a clone of Google page (1998) within 80 minutes.

The only code I took from the original page is:

```value="your e-mail"```

I used
```placeholder=""``` attribute first but I was curious about the original text placeholder which client should delete first to type.

So my webpage is not pixel-perfect but I think it's identical.

- I created colors by Colorzilla extension's color picker which is a tool tells you what color it is when you point the pixel via your cursor.(Google Chrome)
